### Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

I am working on tech for the future of software development and security. 

I am interested in the analysis of automated reasoning procedures in the context of programming languages and formal software verification.

I was fortunate to be a Google PhD Fellow during my PhD at Oxford and have worked at IBM, Microsoft Research, Google and Sonar.

I have co-founded Reviewpad, a SaaS start-up to streamline code reviews with a policy as code approach. Reviewpad was acquired by Snyk in 2023.
