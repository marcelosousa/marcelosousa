### Hi! I'm Marcelo from Reviewpad ðŸ‘‹ 

I am working on [Reviewpad](https://reviewpad.com), a code review product that helps developers easily understand and review code written by others. 

I am very fortunate to be part of an awesome team of:  
:four_leaf_clover:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow developers who believe [Reviewpad](https://reviewpad.com) can improve the life of other developers  
:boom:&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-of-the-box thinkers on a quest to disrupt software development   
:roller_coaster:&nbsp;&nbsp;People with different backgrounds who want to grow and build a business together   

I spend most of my time:  
:busts_in_silhouette:&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking with developers  
:school_satchel:&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning new aspects of building a business   
:sparkler:&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing programs that understand other programs
