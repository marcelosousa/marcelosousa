### Hi! I'm Marcelo from Explore.dev ðŸ‘‹ 

I am working on a code review product to help developers easily understand and review code written by others. 

I am very fortunate to be part of an awesome team of: 

:four_leaf_clover:  Fellow developers who believe [Explore.dev](https://explore.dev/) can improve the life of other developers  
:boom: Out-of-the-box thinkers on a quest to disrupt software development   
:roller_coaster: People with different backgrounds who want to grow and build a business together   

I spend most of my time:

:busts_in_silhouette: Talking with developers  
:school_satchel: Learning new aspects of building a business   
:sparkler: Writing programs that understand other programs

You can reach me at `marcelo at explore dot dev`.
